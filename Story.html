  <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
  <p>
  The year is 1014.</br>
  The people are speaking of a terrible evil spreading from <b>Altamore</b>
  region. Four wizards have gone missing. They were exploring a dungeon full
  of vile creatures the world had never seen before. You, a brave hero of
  <b>Eteria</b> have taken the most dangerous quest yet - putting an end to
  the unknown evil.
  </p>
  <p>
  As you aproach the darkest place your eyes have ever seen, you feel as if
  your soul is changing. Your sight begins to dim. The robes on you, your
  sword and other items you haven't seen start to glow. Your heart starts
  craving for <b>loot and sensing it through the fog.</b>
  </p>
  <p>
  Will you be able to stop this corruption and save your remaining humanity?!
  Are you brave enough to venture <b>into the dungeon</b>?!
  </p>
  <h2 id="neutral">Neutral Ending</h2>
  <p>
  As you combine all <b><i>4 MacGuffins</b></i> your soul begins to shift.
  The goodness in you purges the source of corruption, although not without
  taking a toll.
  </p>
  <p>
  The world feels as a great burden falls off of its shoulders, but the hero
  is never seen again.
  </p>
  <h2 id="evil">Evil ending</h2>
  <p>
  As you combine all <b><i>4 MacGuffins</b></i> your soul begins to shift.
  The corruption in you summons the great evil. Your crave for power
  plunges the world in darkness!
