1. General
=============
Thank You for downloading and playing Into The Dungeon++

Into the Dungeon++ is a roguelike. If You are unfamiliar with roguelikes
I recommend to check the definition on the internet.
(Wikipedia, RogueBasin and Temple of the Roguelike have the full definition)

The game features randomly created dungeons, monsters, items and scrolls.
Can You survive Your dungeon crawling adventure and defeat the Evil that
lurks on the 20th Dungeon Level ?!

Beware of the cursed items (especially potions)!
You cannot unequip cursed items, and cursed potions can be lethal!

The player is afflicted with the corruption, represented by a candle.
It allows You to see loot through the Fog of War but staying too long on
a dungeon level could take the toll of Your life.
