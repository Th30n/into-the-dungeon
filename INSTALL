1. Prerequisites
================

The following libraries are required:

  libsdl >= 1.2
  libsdl-image >= 1.2
  libsdl-mixer >= 1.2

For building you will also need:

  gcc >= 4.8
  make >= 4.0
  cmake >= 3.0

2. Building & Installing
========================

Linux
-----
Out of source build with cmake is preferred.
The simplest way to build is the following:

  $ mkdir build && cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make

And then you can install with (which might require root using su or sudo):

  # make install

If you want additional control over the build configuration, in step 2) run
either:
  * ccmake or
  * cmake-gui

Windows
-------
On Windows you will need to tell CMake where the libraries for SDL can be found.
The easiest way to do that is to run the GUI version of CMake (cmake-gui) and
follow the instructions there.

Mac OS
------
Mac OS is NOT officially supported.
Despite that the Mac OS version can be built by following the instructions
for Linux.
