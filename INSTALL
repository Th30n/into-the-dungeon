1. Prerequisites

The following libraries are required:

  libsdl >= 1.2
  libsdl-image >= 1.2
  libsdl-mixer >= 1.2

For building you will also need:

  gcc >= 4.8
  make >= 4.0
  cmake >= 3.0

2. Building & Installing

Out of source build with cmake is preferred.
The simplest way to build is the following:

  $ mkdir build && cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make

And then you can install with (which might require root using su or sudo):

  # make install

If you want to use a different generator with cmake, for example if you are
on Windows and want to build with CodeBlocks use -G <generator_name> when
calling cmake:

  $ mkdir build && cd build
  $ cmake -G "CodeBlocks" ..

Then open the generated project in CodeBlocks and build from there.
